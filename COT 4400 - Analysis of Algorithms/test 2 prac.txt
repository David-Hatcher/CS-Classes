BFS:
Input:  G = (V, E):  graph with vertex set V and edge set E
Input:  m, n:  order and size of G, respectively
Pseudocode:
Mark all vertices of G as undiscovered
q = Queue()
let root be the first undiscovered vertex in G
degV = deg(root)
i = 1
While some vertex of G is still undiscovered
    Let v0 be the next undiscovered vertex in G
    q.Enqueue(v0)
    Mark v0 as discovered
    While q is not empty:
        v = q.Dequeue()
        Mark v as explored
        For u in N(v):
            If u is discovered and not explored then:
                return true
            If u is undiscovered, q.Enqueue(u) and mark u as discovered
        End for
    End while
End while
