Many operating system features depend on the hardware

The Basic von Neumann Architecture
(See png for picture of this)

Instructions and data for concurrently running processes stored in main memory
Instructions are brought into CPU for execution
Data are brought into CPU for computation
CPU and device controllers execute in parallel
    Controller can execute in parallel with the CPU so they can do their own thing
    The controller connected to the disk can be getting data from the disk to put into memory
        at the same time as the CPU is doing it's thing

The Basic CPU
Registers
    Program counter instruction register
    (Memory on CPU)
    If multiple processes are running and one stops, all of the information needs to be stops if P1 needs to stop for some reason
ALU
    Arithmetic and logical functions
Control
    Controls what is done

The Fetch - Decode - Execute Cycle
    Fetch
        Brings contents of memory address stored in program counter and store the contents instruction register. Increment program counter by one.
    Decode
        Interpret the contents of the instruction register
    Execute
        Do what the instructions say
    Start -> fetch -> decode -> execute -> stop
                /\                    \/
                |_____________________|
    At any part of this cycle, inbetween steps, and interrupt can occur.
        If an interrupt occurs the CPU will stop
The Controller is dedicated to monitor and control the device
It relieves the O.S. from this task
Getting data in and out of the device is extremely slow when compared to CPU speeds.
Typing a word response via keyboard and take a couple of seconds - how many instructions can a CPU execute during that time.
