How to Study for test
    Use slides as focal point
    Ask, why is he putting this slide in this module, What does he want to say with that slide
    Definitely know the shell script information
        Know how to decipher a script or write a simple script

Context Switching
    Context switching is the name given to saving the state of a user process and then loading the CPU with the state of a new user process
    The time taken for context switching is computer time lost
    MEMORIZE THIS
        P1 has CPU
            Interrupt occurs
        OS has the CPU
            Save state of P1 onto the process control block- this will be needed when P1 gets the CPU again!
            Service the interrupt - using the interupt service routine
            Select new user process P2 - there is an algorithm for this selection of the next process
            Restore state of P2 and restart CPU
        P2 has the CPU
    Context Switching time or computer time lost Depends on
        Memory Speed
        speed of saving registers
        # of registers
    Check Textbook for:
        How mulitple register sets can speed context switching
            Allows you to store all of your current registers on the CPU rather than moving to main memory
        Typical times for context switching
            Less than 10 micro seconds
I/O and CPU bound processes
    I/O Bound
        Process spends most of it's time doing I/O
    CPU Bound
        Process spends of its time doing computations
    If all process are I/O bound then the CPU is mostly idle
    If all processes are CPU bound then processes are always waiting on the CPU
    Thus the importance of having the right mix of processes for multiprogramming
    *For a multi user system the size of the time slice should be large enough so that the large majority of the interactive requets take less time than the time slice*
