There is a [ bookshelf ] on the far side of the room. Next to the bookshelf is an overstuffed dark brown leather reclining chair that looks like it has been fallen asleep in while reading on many nights. The lamp is dim, but bright enough for you to see the entirety of the room. There is a hallway leading into the office.
