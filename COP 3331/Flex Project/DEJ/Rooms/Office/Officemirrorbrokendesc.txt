This is a rather small and cramped room. On the right wall hangs the remnants of a oval frame. On the floor beneath the frame lies hundreds of tiny shards of glass. There is a desk on the left wall of the room with papers strewn about, most of these look like bills, in front of the desk sets a small chair with wheels. A single floor lamp sits in the corner. There is a hallway leading into the living room opposite another leading into the library.
