Half of the floor of the room is covered with carpet while the other half is plain cement. In the corner there is a roll of carpet that seems to left for a future project, most likely to finish the carpeting. On the carpeted section of the room there small table in front of an old yellow couch, cushions split from decades of use, it has seen better days. On the cement section there is a washing machine and dryer next to the water heater, you can smell the mold from the washing machine as though the clothes have been sitting in there for weeks. Next to the water heater you see small wooden [ lockbox ] with an elaborately painted mirror on the top of it. Even with the flashlight this room seems dark and uninviting. In small windows at the top edges of the walls, which installed to let in light, have been all but covered with dirt over the years.
