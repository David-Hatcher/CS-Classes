CPU Time Example
    Computer A: 2GHz clock, 10s CPU time
    Designing Computer B
        Aim for 6s CPU time
        Can do faster clock, but causes 1.2 x clock cycles
    How fast much Computer B clock be?
    4GHz
    
    Computer A clock = 3GHz executes a 10^10 cycle program, how long should this take
    3.33 seconds
Instruction Count and CPI
    Clock Cycles = Instruction Count x Cycles per Instruction
    CPU time = Instruction Count x CPI x Clock Cycle Time
    CPU Time = (Instruction Count x CPI)/Clock Rate
    Instruction Count for a program
        Determined by program, ISA and compiler
    Average cycles per Instruction
        Determined by CPU hardware
        If Different instructions have different CPI
            Average CPI affected by instruction mix
CPI in more detail
    If different instruction classes take different numbers of cycles
    Clock cycles = sum(CPIi x Instruction Counti)
    Weighted average CPI
    CPI = Clock cycles/instruction count = sum(CPIi x (Instruction Counti)/Instruction Count)
