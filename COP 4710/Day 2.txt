Key Concepts
    A Data model
    A schema is a design
    A rel. instance is a set
        No duplicates
        No ordering among members
    Relational model
        Started in the early 1970s (E. Codd)
        Dominating model
        No-SQL - there is still a relational component
    Number of attributes of a table is called the degree (arity) of the table
    Number of rows of a table is called cardinality
    Query Language
Relational model
    Tables (relations)
    Main Components of a relation schema
        Table name
        Attributes (columns)
        Constraints
            Domain constraints: rules about valid data in an attribute
                Type + other conditions (app-spec)
            Key constraints:
            Referential constraints: certain column(s) of table A (referncing table) is the primary key of table B (referenced table), foreign key, A and B CAN be the same table
Key Constraints
    SuperKey: A subset of attributes that is a unique ID of a row
    Candidate(lean/essential) key:
        Is a subset of the attributes
        Is an ID of a row
        No proper subset of it is a superkey
        Ex: (SSN,Bdate): proper subsets: (SSN),(Bdate) SSN is already a superkey thus this is not a candidate key
        There can be multiple candidate keys
    Problem: Given (SSN), (Fname,Lname,Bdate)
Relational Algebra
    Alg. System: operators and operands (a domain of values)
    Rel. Alg.
        Domain: relational instances
        Operators: selection(sigma, flat o), projection(PI), rename(row,squiggle p), union(U), intersection(upsidedown U), set difference(-), product(x), join(bowtie), division(/)
                    \______________Uniary_______________/       \_______________________________________________Binary_____________________________________________________/
Selection
    sigma_c (R) -> S
    c = cond logical op cond
    cond: a op b | a op C
    EX: Salary > 50000
        SSN = Dno AND Salary > 50000
    D(R) = D(S)
     |R| >= |S|
Project(ion)
    PI_Ai(R) -> S, Ai subset A(attributes of table R)
    EX. PI_bdate,salary (Employee)
    D(R) >= D(S)
     |R| ==  |S|
