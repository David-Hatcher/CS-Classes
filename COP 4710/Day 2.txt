Key Concepts
    Relational model
        Started in the early 1970s (E. Codd)
        Dominating model
        No-SQL - there is still a relational component
Relational model
    Tables (relations)
    Main Components of a relation schema
        Table name
        Attributes (columns)
        Constraints
            Domain constraints: rules about valid data in an attribute
                Type + other conditions (app-spec)
            Key constraints: 
Key Constraints
    SuperKey: A subset of attributes that is a unique ID of a row
    Candidate(lean/essential) key:
        Is a subset of the attributes
        Is an ID of a row
        No proper subset of it is a superkey
        Ex: (SSN,Bdate): proper subsets: (SSN),(Bdate) SSN is already a superkey thus this is not a candidate key
        There can be multiple candidate keys
    Problem: Given (SSN), (Fname,Lname,Bdate)
