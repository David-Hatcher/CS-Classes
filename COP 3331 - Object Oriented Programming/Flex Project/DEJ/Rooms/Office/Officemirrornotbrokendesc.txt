This is a rather small and cramped room. On the right wall hangs a strange antique oval [ mirror ] that's clouded finish has degraded over time and is specked with black marks. There is a desk on the left wall of the room with papers strewn about, most of these look like bills, in front of the desk sets a small chair with wheels. A single floor lamp sits in the corner. There is a hallway leading into the living room opposite another leading into the library.
