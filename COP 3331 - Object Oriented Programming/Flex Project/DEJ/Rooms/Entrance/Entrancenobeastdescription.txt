This is the entrance to the house. You see a [ door ], the one you came in, it has inset frosted glass in the shape of an oval with the word "Welcome" etched into the glass. And a small night stand with a mirror painted on it with a [ drawer ]. Hanging on the wall are various coats presumeably used for different conditions. To the left of the door are a set of snow boots. On the wall opposite the coats you see decals spelling out the words "Live Laugh Love".
