This small galley kitchen is lined with light wood colored cabinets with [ drawers ]. There is an old refrigerator that looks as though it was cleaned out after Emily's disappearance. The counter tops are a pale yellow that almost matches the color of the linoleum. The appliances look strangely brand new. There is a hallway leading into the living room.
