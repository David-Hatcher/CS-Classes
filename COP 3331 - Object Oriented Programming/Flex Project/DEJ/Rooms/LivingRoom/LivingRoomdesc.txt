This is the largest room in the house. There is a sectional that wraps around a round table, which has a single [ drawer ]. Across from the section rests a TV atop a stand much to big for it. There are pictures on the walls of Emily and her family. Most are from years ago as she looks between 8-12 years old. The left wall has a hallway leading to the office, to the right of that is the hallway leading to the kitchen, the hallway to the right of that leads to Emily's bedroom, while once more to the right leads to the entry way.
