In the center of the room is a bed with an overstuffed comforter. A top the nightstand next to the bed there is a purple diary with a book mark located at what is presumable the last entry in the diary. In the far left corner there is a wooden antique dresser. Across from the door there is a window with the curtains pulled, letting very little light from the outside in.
