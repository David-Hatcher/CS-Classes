To run the code make sure you have "helper.hpp" "Alice.cpp" and "Bob.cpp" in the same folder.
Then enter the following commands:

g++ -Wall -o alice Alice.cpp -lzmq -ltomcrypt
g++ -Wall -o bob Bob.cpp -lzmq -ltomcrypt

After compiling: 

run alice on one terminal using ./alice
run bob on another terminal using ./bob
