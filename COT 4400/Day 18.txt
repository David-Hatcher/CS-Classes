Given the solution of Clique Decision problem, a graph C containing k vertices
You would need to perform the following to determine if this is a valid solution:
Input: Graph G, Graph C, and int k
check if there are k vertices in Graph C                    O(1)
for each vertex in C as v                                   This loop will run k times
    for each other vertex in C as u                         This loop will run k-1 times
        check if isAdjacent_G(u,v)                          O(1) if using an adjacency matrix
    end
end

Since the inner loop will run k-1 time and the outer loop will run k times, and each inner loop has O(1)
the total time complexity will be O(k^2), thus the solution can be validated in poly-time as such this is an NP problem.
