Why Learn About Operating Systems
    To understand computing better
    To make better use of computers
    to write better programs
    to more easily keep up with advances in computing
Best Approach to learn in this course
    Study Slides Carefully
    TAs handle coding questions
    Professor handles conceptual questions
    Start programming assignments early
    Get programming help from TA during office hours
    Finish programming assignments early for extra credit
Read Textbook section 1.1
Which Concepts help us understand operation Systems
    Processes
    Threads
    Scheduling
    Coordination
    Resource Management
    File Organization
    Communication
Our programs never use the hardware
    The program goes through the OS and the OS uses the hardware
Operating Systems
    Make it easier to use the hardware
        Provides device drivers
        allocates memory automatically
        provides synchronization commands
    Manage resources efficiently ans safely
Kernal System Software, Application programs
    Application programs
        What I write
    System Software
        Compilers
        Linkers
        Loaders
        GUI
    Kernel
        CPU scheduler
        Memory Allocator
        Disk, I/O access
    The Kernal is the part of the OS that always runs!
Different features of operating Systems
    Computer SYstems with different goals
        Mobile Devices
        Person Computer Systems
        Servers
        Real Time Systems
        Clustered Systems
        Distributed Systems
    The Design and features of operating systems are closely linked to the type of computer systems they are built for
Personal Computer Systems
    A single user system running several processes concurrently
    A single OS manages concurrent processes across 4 processors
    No need to share resources with other users
    Ease of use is important
Multiple User systems
    A multiple user system running several processes concurrently
    A single OS manages concurrecnt processes across 4 processors and ensures that each user receives a share of CPU time and has acceptable response Time
Real Time Computer System (ie. Computer System for Controlling flaps on an air plane)
    Equipment being controlled requires immediate response which must be provided and guaranteed by the OS
Distributed System
    A group of individual computers linked by a communication network
    No common clock nor memory
    Separate individual operating systems

Check the practice problems at end of slides
    Class notes show two main goals of an OS - one of them is to "Make it easier to use the hardware". Which is the other goal stated int he class notes.
    Describe an important different between an operating system for real-time system control and one for multiple users sharing a computer for a college programming class. Then describe an important similarity.
